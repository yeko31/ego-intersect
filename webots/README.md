# Vision-Based Navigation in Webots: Intersection Detection using Digital Twins

This repository contains the implementation, simulation environments, and evaluation materials for my Master's research project on **vision-based navigation for autonomous robots**.  
The focus of this work is on **detecting and identifying intersections** during robot navigation using **visual input from onboard cameras** within **Webots digital twin environments**.

This project explores how vision-based systems can be used for autonomous navigation in structured road networks.  
It uses **Webots** to simulate realistic environments and **Python-based controllers** for robot perception and decision-making.

### Key Objectives
- Develop a **vision-based navigation pipeline** using onboard cameras.
- Implement **intersection detection and classification**.
- Simulate the approach, detection, and maneuvering behavior in **Webots digital twin environments**.
- Validate the system performance under varying lighting and environmental conditions.
