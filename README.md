# EGOcentric-INTERSECTion 

This repository contains the full implementation of our **vision-based navigation and intersection detection project** using Webots digital twins, along with real-world deployment on the **Crazyflie nano-drone**.  
The project leverages **deep learning models**, **simulation environments**, and **automated data collection** to explore robust navigation strategies.

## 🧠 Grad-CAM Analysis

To understand and visualize the decision-making of our CNN models, we used **Grad-CAM** (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping).  
Grad-CAM highlights regions of the input image that contribute most to the network’s predictions, providing insight into **which visual features the network focuses on** during navigation and intersection detection.

### 🔹 Models Analyzed
- **ResNet50**  
  High-capacity model used for detailed feature extraction. Grad-CAM analysis shows strong attention on **lane markings and intersection cues**.

- **MobileNetV2**  
  Lightweight model suitable for real-time deployment on resource-limited hardware. Grad-CAM highlights key road features while maintaining efficiency.

## 🚁 Real-World Deployment: Crazyflie Nano-Drone

Beyond simulation, we deployed the navigation pipeline on a **Crazyflie nano-drone**.  

The workflow consists of:
1. **Streaming camera frames** from the onboard Crazyflie camera.  
2. **Real-time processing** on an external computer using the trained CNN models.  
3. **Automated control commands** sent back to the drone for navigation.

- The system successfully detects intersections and navigates autonomously in a test environment.  
- Data is logged and categorized into the standard **left_right_forward folder format** for further analysis.
